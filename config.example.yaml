# Tmux window configuration
# The "claude" window is always created first (not configurable).
# These are the additional windows created alongside it.
#
# Window names can be anything you want (e.g., "tests", "server", "docker").
# Commands are optional and run silently when the window is created.
tmux:
  windows:
    # Simple window (just opens a shell)
    - name: logs
      command: docker compose logs -f

    # Window for editing files
    - name: edit
      command: nvim

    # Window with a command that runs on startup
    # The shell stays alive after the command exits
    - name: scratch
      command: echo "Ready to scratch"
